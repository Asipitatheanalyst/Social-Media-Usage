# Social Media Usage Analysis

### Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to analyze social media usage data to identify trends, user behaviors, engagement levels, and platform performance using data sourced from Kaggle. The insights derived will help in:

- Understanding platform popularity and demographics.
- Identifying peak usage times.
- Assessing engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments).
- Supporting content strategy or business decisions based on user activity.

### Tools Used
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Jupyter Notebook**.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and Inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Check for duplicates.
4. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyze the average daily minutes spent per app to understand user engagement.
- Compare the average number of likes and posts per day accross different social media platforms.
- Identify the top apps based on user activity and engagement.

### Visualizations Included
- **Boxplot**: Shows the distribution of user activity by platform.
- **Bar Chart**: Compares average daily likes and posts by social media app.
- **Pie Chart**: Ranks apps by overall user engagement.

### Results
- Facebook and instagram as the highest proportion and Linkedln as low proportion.
- Instagram and Twitter see a high volume of posts and likes, indicating active user participation.
- The top three apps by user count are Snapchat, Linkedln, and Instagram, showcasing their popularity.

### Recommendations
The analysis of social media usage reveals that user behavior varies significantly across different platforms. By understanding these patterns, businesses and content creators can tailor their strategies to maximize engagement. For example, platforms with higher user activity might be ideal for launching new campaigns or ads, while those with more interactions per post can be leveraged for organic reach. Future work can delve into user demographics to create a more detailed user profile.
